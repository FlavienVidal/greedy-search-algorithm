# greedy-search-algorithm
Here is a basic search algorithm.

Search algorithms are one of the most important areas of Artificial Intelligence. They are usually approaches to solving problems for which we start from a given state, and by performing a series of different possible actions, we seek to reach a goal state. For example, when searching for the shortest path to go from an initial position to a final position, or when searching for the best sequence of actions to win a game. All these types of problems can be represented as a tree.
